<p>
In this project, my partner and I set out to make a piano in Python. A unique keyboard key is assigned to each piano key, allowing it to be played like a real piano. To look at my project, please click <a href="https://github.com/ChrisMatthewLee/Piano-Project">here</a>.

Here's a picture of the Keyboard's UI.

When a button is pressed, the key switches color to simulate it being pressed.

Here's a snippet of our code. In this section, the sizes and lengths of keys are defined by the coordinates correlating with each shape. This part wasn't particularly difficult, but it was, in my opinion, the most time consuming part of the project.

I am satisfied with the outcome of the project, and I believe everyone in the group pulled together to make an excellent project.
